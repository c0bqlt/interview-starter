# Interview starter

Create a responsive form with 3 inputs that will send a request to any endpoint.
The input fields should be sale price without VAT as an input, VAT rate as a select and sale price with VAT as an input.
These 3 depend on each other, so whenever the user types a sale price without VAT, the sale price with VAT
should be auto completed (and vice versa).

## Quick start

Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

Start the local server

```bash
npm run dev
```

## Quick tips

You can build any file structure you find useful

You can include any external css files in `site.config.js`

You can use Google, Stack Overflow, previously written code, anything you like.

## Interview goals

- correct problem completion
- hooks usage in React
- responsive and clean design

**Good luck and have fun!**
